gishub import <filename or - for stdin>

  Write row or tabular data for dat. Each row has a primary key column which should be supplied by the user (if not, key column will be auto-generated by dat).

Parameters:

  <filename> (required)

    Parse the given file into rows and store at the given dataset.

  --dataset=<name> (-d) (required)

    The name of the target dataset for data to be stored.

Options:

  --format=[ndjson, csv, json] (-f)

    Format for parsing the file. Dat will try to guess the format if you do not supply it.

  --key=<column> (-k) (recommended)

    The primary key(s) to use. Defaults to auto-generating keys for each row. You can create a compound key by supplying multiple values, for example:

      dat import ... -k <column1> -k <column2> ...
