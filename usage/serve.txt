gishub serve [--port=6442]

  Start an http listener for a dat remote. Supports push/pull/clone. This dat will afterwards be clonable by doing `dat clone http://address-to-this-dat.com` or `dat clone http://{name-of-dat}.dat.local` if you are on the same local network.

Options:

  --readonly

    Run with read only permission, so others can only clone/pull but not push.
